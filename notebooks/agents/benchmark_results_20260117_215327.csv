What is the beta for Bank of America?,valid,fundamental_basic,"The beta for Bank of America (BAC) is **1.295**. This indicates that Bank of America's stock is more volatile than the overall market, as a beta greater than 1 suggests higher sensitivity to market movements.",1,4.84,16.53,208,6.0,,"The response is clear and relevant, but scores low on accuracy and completeness. Beta is a dynamic, calculated value, not a single static number. The agent provides a specific number (1.295) without any context (e.g., time period, benchmark index, source), which is misleading and makes the number's accuracy unverifiable and questionable. A complete answer must include this context to be useful and correct.",
"List all stocks from SBUX, MCD, and TGT with a beta less than 1.0 and a PE ratio above 15.",valid,fundamental_basic,"Based on the provided data, here is the analysis of the stocks SBUX, MCD, and TGT with a beta less than 1.0 and a PE ratio above 15:

1. **MCD (McDonald's Corporation)**:
   - **Beta**: 0.531 (less than 1.0)
   - **PE Ratio**: 26.25 (above 15)
   ✅ **Meets both criteria**

2. **SBUX (Starbucks Corporation)**:
   - **Beta**: Not available (N/A)
   - **PE Ratio**: 57.05 (above 15)
   ❌ **Does not meet criteria** (beta unavailable)

3. **TGT (Target Corporation)**:
   - **Beta**: 1.124 (greater than 1.0)
   - **PE Ratio**: 13.49 (below 15)
   ❌ **Does not meet criteria** (both beta and PE ratio are out of range)

### Final Answer:
Only **MCD (McDonald's Corporation)** meets both conditions: a beta less than 1.0 and a PE ratio above 15.",1,11.32,16.83,742,7.0,,"The agent's response is well-structured and clear, but it contains a critical data error. It incorrectly states that the beta for SBUX is ""Not available,"" which is false for such a major stock. This error leads to the incorrect exclusion of SBUX from the final list, making the answer both inaccurate and incomplete. Based on publicly available data, SBUX's beta is less than 1.0, and it should have been included in the final answer. The analysis of the other two stocks is correct based on the data the agent used.",
Price-to-sales for Coca-Cola.,valid,fundamental_advanced,"The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for Coca-Cola (KO) is not directly available in the provided data. However, we can calculate it using the following formula:

**Price-to-Sales Ratio = Market Capitalization / Total Revenue**

From the data:
- Market Capitalization = $303.15 billion
- Total Revenue (2024-12-31) = $47.06 billion

**P/S Ratio = $303.15B / $47.06B ≈ 6.44**

Thus, Coca-Cola's price-to-sales ratio is approximately **6.44**.",1,7.69,16.5,435,7.0,,"The agent correctly identifies the formula and lays out the calculation clearly. However, the accuracy is poor because it uses questionable input data (a potentially outdated market cap and a future-dated, estimated revenue figure), resulting in an incorrect P/S ratio. While the answer is relevant and clear, it lacks the completeness of a high-quality financial answer, which would include context (like historical or industry comparisons) and use standard, verifiable data (like TTM revenue).",

What was TMO's price at the start of the year?,valid,technical_basic,"The provided tool output does not include historical price data for Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) on January 1 of the current year. As such, it is not possible to determine TMO's price at the start of the year based on the available information. The 52-week low of $385.46 reflects the lowest price during the past 52 weeks, but it may have occurred at any point during that period and is not indicative of the price on January 1. To obtain the accurate opening price for the year, you would need to consult a financial data source such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or a stock market database that provides historical pricing data for specific dates.",2,12.71,10.92,661,8.0,,"The agent's response is highly accurate and clear. It correctly identifies that it does not have the specific historical data required to answer the question. It also provides a helpful and accurate clarification by explaining that the 52-week low is not the same as the price on a specific date. The response is highly relevant, as it directly addresses the query and its limitations. The score for completeness is low because the agent ultimately could not provide the requested price, which was the core of the user's question. However, it was a complete explanation of *why* it could not be answered.",
